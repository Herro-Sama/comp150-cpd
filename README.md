## Week 1
Lego Robot Olympics
Working with my team was quite easy, however our ability to translate from various different hardware configurations was what I believe caused our problems during the actual challenge. In the future considering the hardware in greater detail will help resolve this issue.


## Week 2
Game Concepts
During our time creating and then pitching our group game ideas, I found we weren't making much progress with our ideas until we began prototyping and actually working on once core aspect, while just discussing the ideas presented further debate and didn't lead to anything productive.

## Week 3
Agile
When working as a part of a group it was quite difficult to make any progress, however once we began working on a core idea it became much more productive. We could have spent more time delegating the work and splitting the load amongst members to fully utilise all people in our team. 

## Week 4
Version Control
After spending time initally setting up the version control it became much easier to get the various parts to work, the inital difficulties however took some time to overcome. I have since set up Git and Tortoise Git on both my laptop and Desktop but I need to Sync relatively regularly to make sure that I don't begin editing an outdated version. 

## Week 5
Tinkering Graphics
During my work with Tinkering graphics I had a lot of difficulty initally when it came to creating a pixel array that I could then use to edit colours in an image, I have since figured out how to delete a pixel array which has removed this error.

## Week 6
Scholary Writing
Getting to grips with scholary writing and understanding the key difference between scholary writing and common writing I feel will take time. I will continue to keep in mind the key difference however when going forward with my work.

## Week 7
Introduction to data structures
I have found that data structures were quite simple and yet also very complex, I have an understanding of how it works but I'm still ignorant of how to properly apply data structures into my code effectively.

## Week 8
Tinkering Audio 1
I although I was able to get the task working I don't really have much of an uncerstanding of how the code is actually working, I will continue to think on this until I understand it in more detail.

## Week 9
The programming Pipeling
I have had considerable difficulty in understanding this weeks worksheet, I have yet to overcome this challenge but wil keep myself posted if I do.

## Week 10
The transition to C++
This is going to be difficult for me as I am quite used to working within Python and the Pycharm IDE, I will begin looking at tutorials and creating small projects after this semester to be ready for when I full begin working in C++

## Week 11
The work with Tinkering Audio
Tinkering audio is still very difficult however, some progress is being made. I still need to look into how sound works to get a better understanding of what the code is doing as I feel this knowledge will help me to complete my work for the deadline.

## Weel 12
Managing work
Week 12 is hopefully an anomalous and that their will be less points in time with so many deadlines and other activites.
