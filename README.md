## Week 1
Lego Robot Olympics
Working with my team was quite easy, however our ability to translate from various different hardware configurations was what I believe caused our problems during the actual challenge. In the future considering the hardware in greater detail will help resolve this issue.


## Week 2
Game Concepts
During our time creating and then pitching our group game ideas, I found we weren't making much progress with our ideas until we began prototyping and actually working on once core aspect, while just discussing the ideas presented further debate and didn't lead to anything productive.

## Week 3
Agile
When working as a part of a group it was quite difficult to make any progress, however once we began working on a core idea it became much more productive. We could have spent more time delegating the work and splitting the load amongst members to fully utilise all people in our team. 

## Week 4
Version Control
After spending time initally setting up the version control it became much easier to get the various parts to work, the inital difficulties however took some time to overcome. I have since set up Git and Tortoise Git on both my laptop and Desktop but I need to Sync relatively regularly to make sure that I don't begin editing an outdated version. 

## Week 5
Tinkering Graphics
