## Week 1
Lego Robot Olympics
Working with a team was easy and affective, however our ability to translate from various different hardware configurations was what I believe caused our problems 

## Week 2
Game Concepts
During our time creating and then pitching our group game idea, I found that the delivering of the idea as an elevator pitch was quite difficult. Where as showing the game to play testers was significantly easier with the help of a visual aid.

## Week 3
Agile
When working as a part of a group it was quite difficult to make any progress, however once we began working on a core idea it became much more productive. We could have spent more time delegating the work and splitting the load. 

## Week 4
Version Control
After spending time initally setting up the version control it became much easier to get the various parts to work, the inital difficulties however took some time to overcome.

## Week 5
